// In JavaScript, the await keyword is used in an asynchronous function
// to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is fulfilled or resolved.
// It can only be used within an async function.
// When you use the await keyword before a Promise, 
// it waits for that Promise to settle (either fulfilled or rejected) and 
// then resumes the execution of the async function.
